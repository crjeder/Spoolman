# list-filter-persistence Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change persist-spool-filters. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: List filters persist for the browser tab session
The spool list and filament list SHALL store their active filter values in `sessionStorage`. On page load or when a list component is re-created (e.g. after navigating to a detail page and back), each filter SHALL initialise from its stored value. Stored values SHALL NOT be read from or written to `localStorage`, so filters do not persist across separate tab sessions.

Persisted spool list filters: text search, material, location, color level, picked color, show-archived.
Persisted filament list filters: text search.

#### Scenario: Filter survives navigation within the app
- **WHEN** the user sets the material filter to "PLA" on the spool list, opens a spool detail page, then returns to the spool list
- **THEN** the material filter is still set to "PLA" and the list is filtered accordingly

#### Scenario: Filter survives a tab reload
- **WHEN** the user has an active text search and color level filter and reloads the page in the same tab
- **THEN** both filters are restored to their previous values and the list reflects them

#### Scenario: Filters do not leak to a new tab session
- **WHEN** the user closes the tab and opens the application in a new tab
- **THEN** all list filters are at their default (inactive) state

#### Scenario: Stored filter value is applied on first render
- **WHEN** `sessionStorage` holds a stored location filter and the spool list mounts
- **THEN** the location dropdown shows the stored location and the list is filtered before any user interaction

### Requirement: Clear filters control resets every filter
The spool list and filament list headers SHALL each contain a "Clear filters" button. The button SHALL be visible only when at least one filter on that list is active (non-default). Clicking it SHALL reset every filter on that list to its default value and clear the corresponding `sessionStorage` entries.

#### Scenario: Button hidden when no filter active
- **WHEN** the spool list loads with all filters at their defaults
- **THEN** the "Clear filters" button is not shown

#### Scenario: Button appears when a filter becomes active
- **WHEN** the user types into the text search or selects a material, location, or color level
- **THEN** the "Clear filters" button becomes visible

#### Scenario: Clicking clears all filters at once
- **WHEN** the user has an active text search, material filter, and color level, and clicks "Clear filters"
- **THEN** the text search is emptied, the material filter returns to "All", the color level returns to "Off", and the full list is shown

#### Scenario: Cleared state does not return after navigation
- **WHEN** the user clicks "Clear filters" and then navigates away and back
- **THEN** all filters remain at their defaults
